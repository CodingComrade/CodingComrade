- 👋 Hi, my name is Chris.
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to OSS and building cool personal projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently building front-end projects. Some are static websites, others use JavaScript and APIs. Soon I'll be creating new full-stack projects and adding full-stack implementation to existing ones.
- 💞️ I’m looking to join a motivated team of people that work on fun projects. I'm open to working in full-stack, front-end or back-end roles.
- 📫 You can reach me on my linkedin page www.linkedin.com/in/chris-small-a93651123
